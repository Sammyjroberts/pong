# C PONG

A classic Pong game built in C, built to refresh myself on C programming and to explore the SDL library.

## Getting Started

Provided you have SDL and GCC set up on your machine. The `.vscode` folder is included for convenience, allowing you to easily build and run the game using VSCode.

### Prerequisites

- [**SDL**](https://www.libsdl.org/)
- **GCC:**

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

2. **Open the project in VSCode:**

3. **Build the project:**

   With VSCode open, simply press `Ctrl + Shift + B` to trigger the build process. Make sure the C/C++ plugin is installed in VSCode for this shortcut to work.

4. **Run the game:**

   Once built, you can run the game by typing the following command in the terminal:

   ```bash
   ./pong
   ```

## Feel free to fork the project or do anything you want with it, let me know if you do something cool
